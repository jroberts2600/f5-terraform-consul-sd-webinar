Terraform: Step #2
==================

After you complete Step #1 you should see URLs for Consul and BIG-IP.

.. image:: ./images/terraform-1-complete.png

.. warning:: It may take several minutes for the BIG-IP to become available.

Visit these URLS.

Consul
------

.. image:: ./images/terraform-2-consul.png

BIG-IP
------

.. image:: ./images/terraform-2-big-ip.png

You may have to wait a few minutes before you can login.	   

Deploy AS3 Declaration
----------------------

On the Ubuntu host run the following commands

.. code-block:: shell
  
  $ cd ~/f5-terraform-consul-sd-webinar/as3/
  $ terraform init
  $ terraform plan
  $ terraform apply
  
In this scenario we are executing a shell script that will
deploy the "nginx.json" declaration that is configure to use Consul's API for
service discovery.

You should see the following output.

.. image:: ./images/terraform-2-as3-installed.png

Follow the URL and you should see NGINX.

.. image:: ./images/terraform-2-nginx-1.png

At this point you should observe that on the BIG-IP there is partition named "Consul_SD".  Select the partition (top right of screen).

This partition was created by the "nginx.json" that contains the following.

.. code-block:: JavaScript
   
   {
     "class": "ADC",
     "schemaVersion": "3.7.0",
     "id": "Consul_SD",
     "Consul_SD": {
       "class": "Tenant",
       "Nginx": {
	 "class": "Application",
	 "template": "http",
	 "serviceMain": {
	   "class": "Service_HTTP",
	   "virtualPort": 8080,
	   "virtualAddresses": [
	     "10.0.0.200"
	   ],
	   "pool": "web_pool",
	   "persistenceMethods": [],
	   "profileMultiplex": {
	     "bigip": "/Common/oneconnect"
	    }
	 },
	 "web_pool": {
	   "class": "Pool",
	   "monitors": [
	     "http"
	   ],
	   "members": [
	     {
	       "servicePort": 80,
	       "addressDiscovery": "consul",
	       "updateInterval": 10,
	       "uri": "http://10.0.0.100:8500/v1/catalog/service/nginx"
	     }
	   ]
	 }
       }
     }
   }

Once the partition is selected you should observe there is a pool named "web_pool" and there is a single pool member.  In the next step we will increase the number of NGINX nodes and you will see the change reflected on the BIG-IP.
